<h2>Introduction</h2>
When developing custom controls for ASP.NET, it may be necessary to create
some client-side script that is used to interact with the custom control.
There may also be image files that are used for certain elements of the
control, such as buttons or style sheets that set the look of the control.
A decision has to be made about how to deploy these resources with the
custom control assembly.

<p/>Script can be built up using a <code>StringBuilder</code> or a static
string, and inserted directly into the page using
<code>RegisterClientScriptBlock</code>. This is okay for small scripts, but
is unwieldy for much larger scripts, especially if they are complex enough
to need debugging to work out problems during development. Scripts can also
be embedded as resources in the assembly, retrieved at runtime, and again
inserted into the page using <code>RegisterClientScriptBlock</code>. This
is better than the <code>StringBuilder</code> approach for large scripts,
but it is still inserted into the page and is rendered in its entirety,
every time the page is requested. The more script code you have or the more
controls on the page that render supporting script code, the larger the
page gets. The script also cannot be cached on the client to save time on
subsequent requests.

<p/>The scripts can be distributed as separate files along with the
assembly. This solves the problem of the code being rendered in the page on
each request and it can be cached on the client. However, it may complicate
distribution of the custom control. It is no longer a simple XCOPY
deployment as now scripts have to be installed along with the assembly. A
number of factors such as whether it is a production or development server,
whether or not the application is using SSL, and how the end-user's
applications are set up, can affect where the scripts go, and you may end
up with multiple copies in several locations. Versioning issues may also
come into play if the scripts are modified in future releases of the
control.

<p/>To solve these issues, I developed a class that implements the
<code>System.Web.IHttpHandler</code> interface and acts as a resource
server of sorts. The idea was inspired by examples I saw that showed how to
render dynamic images using an ASPX page as the source of the
<code>image</code> tag. The concept is basically the same for the resource
server handler. You embed the resources in the control assembly and then
add a simple class to your custom control assembly that implements the
<code>IHttpHandler</code> interface. A section is added to the
application's <i>Web.Config</i> file to direct resource requests to the
handler class. The handler class uses parameters in the query string to
determine the content type and sends back the appropriate resource such as
a script, an image, a style sheet, or any other type of data that you need.

<p/>By having the resources embedded in the assembly and serving them as
needed, there is as little code rendered in the page as possible by the
controls. The resource handler responses can also be cached on the client,
so performance can be improved as less information is sent to the client in
subsequent page requests that utilize the same resources. This is most
beneficial for users with slow dial-up connections, especially on forms
that utilize controls with auto-postback enabled. The resources do not have
to be deployed separately along with the assembly either, thus solving the
problem of where to install the resources, as well as any issues involving
versioning. We are back to a simple XCOPY deployment again.

<p/>The use of a resource server handler is not restricted to custom
controls. It also adds the ability to do such things as request dynamic
content, such as XML, using client-side script. For example, a request
could be made to retrieve the results of a database query as XML using
client-side script. The results could be used to populate a control or a
popup window with information when it is needed rather than sending
everything along with the page when first loaded. The following sections
describe how to setup and utilize the resource server handler class.

<h2>A Word About ASP.NET 2.0</h2>
The following will allow you to embedded and serve resources in ASP.NET 1.1
applications as well as ASP.NET 2.0 applications.  However, with ASP.NET
2.0 the ability to serve embedded web resources is a built-in feature and
is simpler to implement.  It makes use of embedded resources as described
in here but utilizes attributes to define them along with a built-in
<code>Page.ClientScript</code> method to render a link to them to the client.
It does not require you to write a handler and does not require any entries in
the <i>Web.config</i> file to define the handler or to allow anonymous access
to them.  Gary Dryden has already written a good article on how this works so
I will just refer you to it rather than repeating what it has to say
(<a href="http://www.codeproject.com/aspnet/MyWebResourceProj.asp">WebResource
ASP.NET 2.0 Explained</a>
[<a href="http://www.codeproject.com/aspnet/MyWebResourceProj.asp"
target=_blank>^</a>]).

<h2>Add Resources to Your Project</h2>
To keep things organized, store the resources in separate folders grouped
by type (<i>Scripts</i> for script files, <i>Images</i> for image files,
etc.). To create a new folder in the project, right click on the project
name, select <i>Add</i>..., select <i>New Folder</i>, and enter the folder
name. Add a new resource to the folder by right clicking on it, and
selecting <i>Add</i>... and then <i>Add New Item</i>... to create a new
item, or <i>Add Existing Item</i>... if you copied an existing file to the
new folder. Once added to the project folder, right click on the file and
select <i>Properties</i>. Change the <i>Build Action</i> property from
<i>Content</i> to <i>Embedded Resource</i>. This step is the most important
as it indicates that you want the file to be embedded as a resource in the
compiled assembly.

<h2>Add the ResSrvHandler Class to Your Project</h2>
Add the <i>ResSrvHandler.cs</i> source file to your control's project and
modify it as follows. <i>TODO:</i> comments have been added to help you
find the sections that need modification.

<p/>Modify the namespace so that it matches the one for your custom control.

<pre lang="cs">
// TODO: Change the namespace to match your control's namespace.
namespace ResServerTest.Web.Controls
{
</pre>

<p/>Modify the <code>cResSrvHandlerPageName</code> constant so that it
matches the name you will use in the application's <i>Web.Config</i> file
to direct resource requests to the class. I have chosen to use the custom
control namespace with an <i>.aspx</i> extension. This keeps it unique and
guarantees that it won't conflict with something in the end-user's
application.

<pre lang="cs">
// TODO: Modify this constant to name the ASPX page that will be
// referenced in the application <b>Web.Config</b> file to invoke this
// handler class.

/// &lt;summary&gt;
/// The ASPX page name that will cause requests to get routed
/// to this handler.
/// &lt;/summary&gt;
public const string cResSrvHandlerPageName =
    "ResServerTest.Web.Controls.aspx";
</pre>

<p/>Modify the <code>cImageResPath</code> and <code>cScriptResPath</code>
constants to point to your script and image paths. Add additional constants
for other resource type paths as needed. The names of the embedded
resources in the assembly are created by using the default namespace of the
project plus the folder path to the resource. The default namespace is
usually the same as the assembly name but you can modify it by right
clicking on the project name, selecting <i>Properties</i>, and changing the
<i>Default Namespace</i> option in the <i>General</i> section of the
<i>Common Properties</i> entry. For the demo, the default namespace has
been changed to match the namespace of the control,
<code>ResServerTest.Web.Controls</code>, and the resource paths are
<i>Images</i> and <i>Scripts</i>. As such, the constants are defined as
shown below. The trailing "." should also be included. The resource name
will be appended to the appropriate constant when loading it from the
assembly.

<p/>Note that if you are using VB.NET, the default behavior of the compiler
differs from the C# compiler. It will not append the default namespace to
the front of the resource filename unless you explicitly include the
command line option to tell it to do that. As such, for VB.NET projects,
you can omit the path constants or set them to empty strings.

<pre lang="cs">
// TODO: Modify these two constants to match your control's
// namespace and the folder names of your resources.  Add any
// additional constants as needed for other resource types.

/// &lt;SUMMARY&gt;
/// The path to the image resources
/// &lt;/SUMMARY&gt;
private const string cImageResPath =
    "ResServerTest.Web.Controls.Images.";

/// &lt;SUMMARY&gt;
/// The path to the script resources
/// &lt;/SUMMARY&gt;
private const string cScriptResPath =
    "ResServerTest.Web.Controls.Scripts.";
</pre>

<p/>The <code>ResourceUrl</code> methods can be called to format the URL
used to retrieve an embedded resource from an assembly. The first version
will retrieve the named resource from the assembly that contains the class.
Simply pass it the name of the resource and it returns a URL that points to
the resource.

<p/>The second version of the method can be used to extract embedded
resources from assemblies other than the one containing the resource server
class. Pass it the name of the assembly that contains the resource (without
a path or extension, <code>System.Web</code> for example), the name of the
resource handler that can retrieve it (i.e., the class defined in the
<code>cResSrvHandlerPageName</code> constant), and the name of the resource
to retrieve. When using this version, the name of the resource will be
matched to the first resource that ends with the specified name. This
allows you to skip the path name if you do not know it or extract resources
from VB.NET assemblies which do not store the path.

<pre lang="cs">
/// &lt;summary&gt;
/// This can be called to format a URL to a resource name that is
/// embedded within the assembly.
/// &lt;/summary&gt;
/// &lt;param name="strResourceName"&gt;The name of the resource&lt;/param&gt;
/// &lt;param name="bCacheResource"&gt;Specify true to have the
/// resource cached on the client, false to never cache it.&lt;/param&gt;
/// &lt;returns&gt;A string containing the URL to the resource&lt;/returns&gt;
public static string ResourceUrl(string strResourceName,
  bool bCacheResource)
{
    return String.Format("{0}?Res={1}{2}", cResSrvHandlerPageName,
        strResourceName, (bCacheResource) ? "" : "&amp;NoCache=1");
}

/// &lt;summary&gt;
/// This can be called to format a URL to a resource name that is
/// embedded within a different assembly.
/// &lt;/summary&gt;
/// &lt;param name="strAssemblyName"&gt;The name of the assembly that
/// contains the resource&lt;/param&gt;
/// &lt;param name="strResourceHandlerName"&gt;The name of the resource
/// handler that can retrieve it (i.e. the ASPX page name)&lt;/param&gt;
/// &lt;param name="strResourceName"&gt;The name of the resource&lt;/param&gt;
/// &lt;param name="bCacheResource"&gt;Specify true to have the
/// resource cached on the client, false to never cache it.&lt;/param&gt;
/// &lt;returns&gt;A string containing the URL to the resource&lt;/returns&gt;
public static string ResourceUrl(string strAssemblyName,
  string strResourceHandlerName, string strResourceName,
  bool bCacheResource)
{
    return String.Format("{0}?Assembly={1}&amp;Res={2}{3}",
        strResourceHandlerName,
        HttpContext.Current.Server.UrlEncode(strAssemblyName),
        strResourceName, (bCacheResource) ? "" : "&amp;NoCache=1");
}
</pre>

<p/>The <code>IHttpHandler.IsReusable</code> property is implemented to
indicate that the object instance can be reused for other requests. The
<code>IHttpHandler.ProcessRequest</code> method is implemented to do all of
the work. The first step is to determine the requested resource's name and
its type. I use the filename's extension to determine the type. The code
assumes that the query string parameter is called <code>Res</code>. Adjust
this if you choose a different parameter name. Likewise, you can modify the
code to determine the resource name and type in any number of ways
depending on your needs.

<pre lang="cs">
/// &lt;summary&gt;
/// Load the resource specified in the query string and return
/// it as the HTTP response.
/// &lt;/summary&gt;
/// &lt;param name="context"&gt;The context object for the
/// request&lt;/param&gt;
public void ProcessRequest(HttpContext context)
{
    Assembly asm;
    StreamReader sr = null;
    Stream s = null;

    string strResName, strType;
    byte[] byImage;
    int nLen;
    bool bUseInternalPath = true;

    // TODO: Be sure to adjust the QueryString names if you are
    // using something other than Res and NoCache.

    // Get the resource name and base the type on the extension
    strResName = context.Request.QueryString["Res"];
    strType = strResName.Substring(strResName.LastIndexOf(
        '.') + 1).ToLower();
</pre>

<p/>The next step is to clear any current response and set up the caching
options. If the <code>NoCache</code> query string parameter has not been
specified, the class sets the necessary page caching options in the
<code>context.Response.Cache</code> object. If it has been specified, the
options are set such that the response will never be cached. The class
defaults to having the response cached for one day. Adjust this as
necessary for your controls. The response is set to vary caching by
parameter name. The default class only has one parameter called
<code>Res</code>. If you have additional parameters, be sure to add them as
additional <code>VaryByParams</code> entries.

<pre lang="cs">
context.Response.Clear();

// If caching is not disabled, set the cache parameters so that
// the response is cached on the client for up to one day.
if(context.Request.QueryString["NoCache"] == null)
{
    // TODO: Adjust caching length as needed.

    context.Response.Cache.SetExpires(
        DateTime.Now.AddDays(1));
    context.Response.Cache.SetCacheability(
        HttpCacheability.Public);
    context.Response.Cache.SetValidUntilExpires(false);

    // Vary by parameter name.  Note that if you have more
    // than one, add additional lines to specify them.
    context.Response.Cache.VaryByParams["Res"] = true;
}
else
{
    // The response is not cached
    context.Response.Cache.SetExpires(
        DateTime.Now.AddDays(-1));
    context.Response.Cache.SetCacheability(
        HttpCacheability.NoCache);
}
</pre>

<p/>The next section checks to see if the resource resides in another
assembly. If the <code>Assembly</code> query string option has been
omitted, it assumes the resource is in the same assembly as the class. If
specified, it looks for the named assembly and, if found, searches for the
resource within its manifest. When loading from a different assembly, the
internal class path names are ignored and the name matched during the
search is used instead.

<pre lang="cs">
// Get the resource from this assembly or another?
if(context.Request.QueryString["Assembly"] == null)
    asm = Assembly.GetExecutingAssembly();
else
{
    Assembly[] asmList =
        AppDomain.CurrentDomain.GetAssemblies();
    string strSearchName =
        context.Request.QueryString["Assembly"];

    foreach(Assembly a in asmList)
        if(a.GetName().Name == strSearchName)
        {
            asm = a;
            break;
        }

    if(asm == null)
        throw new ArgumentOutOfRangeException("Assembly",
            strSearchName, "Assembly not found");

    // Now get the resources listed in the assembly manifest
    // and look for the filename.  Note the fact that it is
    // matched on the filename and not necessarily the path
    // within the assembly.  This may restricts you to using
    // a filename only once, but it also prevents the problem
    // that the VB.NET compiler has where it doesn't seem to
    // output folder names on resources.
    foreach(string strResource in asm.GetManifestResourceNames())
        if(strResource.EndsWith(strResName))
        {
            strResName = strResource;
            bUseInternalPath = false;
            break;
        }
}
</pre>

<p/>As given, the class can serve up various image and script types, some
styles for the demo, plus an additional XML file to demonstrate the
<code>NoCache</code> option. A simple <code lang="cs">switch</code> statement
is used to determine what type to send back. The
<code>context.Response.ContentType</code> property is set accordingly, the
resource is retrieved, and it is then written to the response stream. You
can expand or reduce the code to suit your needs.

<pre lang="cs">
switch(strType)
{
    case "gif":     // Image types
    case "jpg":
    case "jpeg":
    case "bmp":
    case "png":

    case "tiff":
        if(strType == "jpg")
            strType = "jpeg";
        else
            if(strType == "png")
                strType = "x-png";
            else
                if(strType == "tif")
                    strType = "tiff";

        context.Response.ContentType = "image/" + strType;

        if(bUseInternalPath == true)
            strResName = cImageResPath + strResName;

        s = asm.GetManifestResourceStream(strResName);

        nLen = Convert.ToInt32(s.Length);
        byImage = new Byte[nLen];
        s.Read(byImage, 0, nLen);

        if(bUseInternalPath == true)
            strResName = cScriptResPath + strResName;

        sr = new StreamReader(
            asm.GetManifestResourceStream(strResName));
        context.Response.Write(sr.ReadToEnd());
        break;

    case "css":     // Some style sheet info
        // Not enough to embed so we'll write it out from here

            context.Response.Write(sr.ReadToEnd());
        }
        break;

    case "htm":     // Maybe some html
    case "html":

        sr = new StreamReader(

        sr = new StreamReader(
            asm.GetManifestResourceStream(
            "ResServerTest.Web.Controls." + strResName));

        // This is used to demonstrate the NoCache option.
        // We'll modify the XML to show the current server
        // date and time.
        string strXML = sr.ReadToEnd();

        context.Response.Write(strXML.Replace("DATETIME",
            DateTime.Now.ToString()));
        break;

    default:    // Unknown resource type
        throw new Exception("Unknown resource type");
}
</pre>

<p/>For simple text-based resources such as scripts, the
<code>StreamReader.ReadToEnd</code> method can be used to retrieve the
resource. For binary resources such as images, you must allocate an array
and use <code>StreamReader.Read</code> to load the image into the array.
Once loaded, you can write the array out to the client as shown above.

<p/>If an unknown resource type is requested or it cannot be loaded from
the assembly, an exception is thrown. For script resource types, the
exception handler will convert the response to the appropriate type and
send back a message box or alert so that the exception is displayed when
the page loads. This will give you a chance to see what failed during
development. For an XML resource, the exception handler will send back an
XML response containing nodes with the resource name and the error
description. For all other resource types, nothing is returned. Images will
display a broken image placeholder, which serves as an indication that you
may have done something wrong.

<pre lang="cs">
catch(Exception excp)
{
    XmlDocument xml;
    XmlNode node, element;

    string strMsg = excp.Message.Replace("\r\n", " ");

    context.Response.Clear();
    context.Response.Cache.SetExpires(
        DateTime.Now.AddDays(-1));
    context.Response.Cache.SetCacheability(
        HttpCacheability.NoCache);

    // For script, write out an alert describing the problem.
    // For XML, send an XML response containing the exception.
    // For all other resources, just let it display a broken
    // link or whatever.
    switch(strType)

<h2>Using the Resource Server Handler in Your Control</h2>
Using the resource server handler in the custom control is very simple.
Just add code to your class to render the attributes, script tags, or other
resource types such as images that utilize the resource server page name.
This is done by calling the <code>ResSrvHandler.ResourceUrl</code> method
with the name of the resource and a Boolean flag indicating whether or not
to cache it on the client. The demo control contains several examples.

<pre lang="cs">
// An image
img = new HtmlImage();

// Renders as:
// src="ResServerTest.Web.Controls.aspx?Res=FitHeight.bmp"
img.Src = ResSrvHandler.ResourceUrl("FitHeight.bmp", true);

// Call a function in the client-side script code registered below
img.Attributes["onclick"] = "javascript: FitToHeight()";

this.Controls.Add(img);

// Register the client-side script module
// Renders as: &lt;script type='text/javascript'
// src='ResServerTest.Web.Controls.aspx?Res=DemoCustomControl.js'&gt;
// &lt;/script&gt;
this.Page.RegisterStartupScript("Demo_Startup",
    "&lt;script type='text/javascript' src='" +
    ResSrvHandler.ResourceUrl("DemoCustomControl.js", true) +
    "'&gt;&lt;/script&gt;");

// Register the style sheet
// Renders as: &lt;link rel='stylesheet' type='text/css'
// href='ResServerTest.Web.Controls.aspx?Res=Styles.css'&gt;
this.Page.RegisterScriptBlock("Demo_Styles",
    "&lt;link rel='stylesheet' type='text/css' href='" +
    ResSrvHandler.ResourceUrl("Styles.css") + "'&gt;\n");
</pre>

<p/>As noted earlier, the lack of the <code>NoCache</code> query string
option will cause the resources to be cached on the client. To turn off
caching for a resource, simply specify <code lang="cs">false</code> for the
cache parameter of the <code>ResourceUrl</code> methods, or add the
<code>NoCache</code> parameter to the query string if hand-coding the URL.
The demo ASPX page contains an example that retrieves an XML document from
the control assembly. It uses the no caching option so that it displays the
current time on the server every time the XML resource is requested. It
also contains a couple of examples that retrieve resources from assemblies
other than the custom control's assembly.

<pre lang="jscript">
&lt;script type='text/javascript'&gt;
// Demonstrate the loading of uncached, dynamic resources outside the
// control class.  This gets some XML from the resource server page.
function funShowXML()
{
    window.open('ResServerTest.Web.Controls.aspx?Res=Demo.xml&amp;NoCache=1',
         null,
        'menubar=no,personalbar=no,resizable=yes,scrollbars=yes,status=no,' +
        'toolbar=no,screenX=50,screenY=50,height=400,width=800').focus()
}
&lt;/script&gt;
</pre>

<h2>Using the Control and the Resource Server Handler in an Application</h2>
In the application's project, add a reference to your custom control's
assembly and add your custom control to the application's forms in the
normal fashion. To use the resource server handler, add an entry in the
<code lang="xml">&lt;system.web&gt;</code> section of your application's
<i>Web.Config</i> file like the following:

<pre lang="xml">
&lt;!-- Demo Control Resource Server Handler
     Add this section to map the resource requests to the resource
     handler class in the custom control assembly. --&gt;
&lt;httpHandlers&gt;
  &lt;add verb="*" path="ResServerTest.Web.Controls.aspx"
     type="ResServerTest.Web.Controls.ResSrvHandler,
     ResServerTest.Web.Controls"/&gt;
&lt;/httpHandlers&gt;
</pre>

<p/>Modify the <code>path</code> attribute so that it matches the
<code>ResSrvHandler.cResSrvHandlerPageName</code> constant. Modify the
<code>type</code> attribute to reference your resource server handler's
class name (including its namespace) followed by a comma and then the name
of the assembly. This entry causes any requests containing the page name
specified in the <code>path</code> attribute, regardless of folder, to get
mapped to your resource handler class.

<h2>Allowing Anonymous Access to Resources When Using Forms-Based Authentication</h2>
When using forms-based authentication to secure an entire application,
access to the resources is prevented on the logon page because the above
HTTP handler uses an ASPX page name to route the requests for resources to
the handler. As such, it is treated like any other request for a normal
page, and instead of returning the resource, ASP.NET redirects the request
to the login page as well. To prevent this and allow anonymous access to
the resource server handler from the logon page, the following section
should be added to the <code>&lt;configuration&gt;</code> section of your
<i>Web.config</i> file.

<pre lang="xml">
&lt;!-- This is needed to allow anonymous access to the resource server
     handler for the ResServerTest.Web.Controls namespace from a logon
     web form when using forms-based authentication. --&gt;
&lt;location path="ResServerTest.Web.Controls.aspx"&gt;
    &lt;system.web&gt;
        &lt;authorization&gt;
            &lt;allow users="*"/&gt;
        &lt;/authorization&gt;
    &lt;/system.web&gt;
&lt;/location&gt;
</pre>

<p/>This allows all users to access the resources without authentication,
thus allowing the classes and controls in the assembly that utilize the
resource server handler to be used on the logon web form. Just modify the
page name in the <code>path</code> attribute of the <code>location</code>
tag to match the one used in the HTTP handler section.

<h2>Common Errors and Problems</h2>
The most common errors when using the resource server handler are
misspelling the resource name and forgetting to change the <i>Build
Action</i> property to <i>Embedded Resource</i>. In both cases, the error
<code lang="text">Value cannot be null. Parameter name: stream</code> is
returned for script and XML resources. Image resources just won't display
anything. The demo project contains examples of these errors.

<p/>Another common error is misspelling the ASPX page name when referencing
it in the <i>Web.Config</i> file or in web forms when retrieving dynamic
content. In these cases, you will get broken links or "resource not found"
errors. If you misspell the class or assembly name in the <i>Web.Config</i>
file, the application will fail to start, and you will get an error telling
you that it cannot find the specified type or assembly. The type or
assembly shown in the error message will be the incorrect name for the
resource handler class or its assembly. Correcting the names will resolve
the errors.

<p/>A problem that can occur during development is making modifications to
the resources and then not seeing those changes reflected when testing the
control. The reason for this is that embedded resources do not create a
build dependency. As such, modifying them does not cause a rebuild of the
assembly. When making such changes, you just have to remember to always
force a rebuild of the assembly so that it embeds the updated resources.
You may also have to force a refresh of the page to get it to download the
updated resource (Ctrl+F5 in Internet Explorer for example).

<p/>You can test the retrieval of a resource and view what gets returned by
opening the browser and entering the URL to the resource. For text-based
resources, prefix the URL with "view-source:". For example:

<pre lang="text">
view-source:http://localhost/ResSrvTest/ResServerTest.Web.
Controls.aspx?Res=DemoCustomControl.js
</pre>

<p/>This would retrieve the <i>DemoCustomControl.js</i> file and display it
in a Notepad window.

<h2>The Demo</h2>
To try out the demo application and custom control, create a virtual
directory in IIS called <b>ResSrvTest</b> and point it at the
<i>DotNet\Web\ReServerTest\ResSrvTest</i> folder. The startup page is
<i>WebForm1.aspx</i>. The demo project is set up to compile and run on a
development machine that has Visual Studio .NET 2003 and IIS running on it.
If you are using a remote server, you will need to set up the virtual
directory, build the demo custom control separately, and copy it and the
demo application files to the server location.

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
I have used this method in my custom controls that utilize client-side
script and image files, and have found it to be quite useful. Development
of the controls involving client-side script has been made easier as has
the deployment of the control assemblies.
